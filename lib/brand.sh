# =============================================================================
# Boxa brand — single source of truth for the product name and every
# runtime value derived from it (ADR 0005 family; release issue #05).
# =============================================================================
# Sourced by:
#   - docker-run.sh (host)        for IMAGE, the config dir, shared-infra names
#   - build.sh      (host)        for IMAGE and the container-name pattern
#   - install.sh    (host)        — see note below; the repo slug is needed
#                                   pre-clone so install keeps its own copy of
#                                   CLI_NAME but cross-checks against this file
#                                   once the repo is in place.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# --------------------
# The product name "boxa" is woven into ~180 files: image tags, ~/.config
# paths, /var/log paths, docker container/volume names, OS users, a bridge
# group, the GitHub repo slug, and the BOXA_* env-var prefix. A rename used
# to mean a coordinated edit across all of them. This file makes the name a
# single constant (`CLI_NAME`) plus a set of derived values, so the rename
# (release issue #06) becomes a one-line flip here plus a prose/filenames
# sweep — not a hunt through every script.
#
# HISTORY: issue #05 introduced this file with `CLI_NAME="devbox"` so every
# derived value expanded byte-for-byte to the literal it replaced. Issue #06
# then flipped `CLI_NAME` to "boxa" and swept the remaining inlined literals
# (fixed filenames, prose, help text). This file now owns the brand; the rest
# of the tree derives from it or was swept once.
# =============================================================================

# All constants are consumed by sourcing scripts; shellcheck can't see that.

# --- The brand ---------------------------------------------------------------
# The one thing a rename changes. Everything else derives from it.
CLI_NAME="boxa"

# Uppercased form, used as the env-var prefix (BOXA_*). Computed, not
# hand-typed, so it stays in lockstep with CLI_NAME.
CLI_NAME_UPPER="$(printf '%s' "$CLI_NAME" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')"

# --- Image ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The image is built locally (no registry — local-first is a design goal) and
# tagged under a namespace kept as its own constant, so it can move
# independently of the CLI name. Aligned to the repo owner: `vilos/boxa:latest`.

# --- Docker object names -----------------------------------------------------
# Per-project objects use the dash prefix (`<cli>-<project>`); shared infra
# uses an underscore separator so it can never collide with a sanitized
# project token (ADR 0007). Shared volumes follow the dash prefix.

# Container-name pattern matching every boxa-managed container: the broad
# dash-prefix half (only `boxa::sanitize` produces those) plus the two
# explicit underscore infra names. Mirrors BOXA_CONTAINER_PATTERN in
# build.sh and BOXA_SHARED_CONTAINER_NAMES in docker-run.sh.

# --- Source repository -------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub owner/repo slug. install.sh needs this BEFORE the repo is cloned, so
# it cannot source this file for the bootstrap clone; it carries its own copy
# and is expected to match BRAND_REPO_SLUG once the checkout exists.

# --- Default dotfiles starter (chezmoi) --------------------------------------
# The default dotfiles source offered during `install.sh` and used as the
# fallback CHEZMOI_REPO in docker-run.sh when the user has not chosen otherwise
# (release issues #09/#10). This is the `bundled` sentinel: boxa ships a curated
# chezmoi starter inside the image (Dockerfile COPYs `dotfiles/` →
# /usr/local/share/boxa/dotfiles) and setup-chezmoi.sh applies it locally with
# `chezmoi apply --source` — no network, no clone, no separate repo to trust
# (same local-first stance as ADR 0018). A user who picks their own chezmoi repo
# at install time gets a real URL here instead, which takes the remote path.
